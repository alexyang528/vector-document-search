Your job is to clean a segment of text, extracted from a book, article, or other long document.

Below are some guidelines for what a cleaned segment means:

- Remove any extraneous punctuation or spacing
- Remove any newlines splitting up sentences
- Replace any incorrect punctuation with the correct characters
- Remove any content that appears to be from document headers or footers (e.g., page numbers or chapter titles)

You are NOT to change any of the contents of the segments, besides cleaning and correcting the formatting.

Respond only with the cleaned segment.

# Original Segment
